# PCA and Binary Classification on Office Room Occupancy
---------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------
## Abstract:
> Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a fast and flexible unsupervised dimensionality reduction method that transforms a high dimensional data with correlated features to low dimenesional data with uncorrelated features. This report illustrates the use of PCA when applied to the office room occupancy data set attributes to classifiy if the room is occupied. Determination of occupancy detection in a room can lead to considerable energy savings in modern smart home/buildings. **~~Still some part remaining~~**

## Ⅰ. Introduction:

With the decreasing price of sensors and the availability of reasonable computational power for automation systems, determining occupancy is a very promising way to lowering energy usage in buildings through appropriate control of HVAC and lighting systems. Threat of climate adversity has made it important for the production of most energy efficient products [1]. The precise detection of occupancy in buildings has lately been projected to save energy in the range of 30 to 42 percent [2-4]. When occupancy data was employed as an input for HVAC control algorithms, it resulted in energy savings of 37 percent withour sacrificing indoor climate in [5] and between 29 and 80 percent in [6]. Determining building inhabitants behavior and Security are two more applications for occupancy detection. The research [7] used data from light, temperature, humidity, and CO2 sensors to detect occupancy, as well as a digital camera to determine ground occupancy for data labelling. This data set created for occupancy detection is analysed in this study.
The rest of the report covers these: Section Ⅱ explains the PCA algorithm, Section Ⅲ discusses the applicable Classfiers, Section Ⅳ gives the data set description, Section Ⅴ inlcudes the PCA results, Section Ⅵ makes a comparison in the classification results, and Section Ⅶ closes with a summary of the findings.

## Ⅱ. Principal Component Analysis:

PCA is typically used to reduce the dimensionality of data while retaining as much of the information present in the original data as feasible. It does this by examining a data table including observations characterised by numerous dependent variables that are, in general, inter-correlated. Its purpose is to extract the key information from the data table and express this information as a set of new orthogonal variables known as principal components. Simply put, PCA is important so as to:

1. Extract the most relevant information from the data table, 
2. Compress the size of the data set by maintaining just the most significant information, 
3. Simplify the data set description, and 
4. Evaluate the structure of the observations and variables [8].

PCA output comprises of coefficients that specify the linear combinations used to obtain the new variables (PC loadings) as well as the new variables themselves (PCs). The first PC must have the greatest potential variance. The second component is calculated with the constraint of being orthogonal to the first component and having the greatest possible inertia. The other components are calculated in the same way. [8]
