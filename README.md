- A few cleaned datasets and notebooks with PCA performed on them. 
- Collected from [UCI ML repository](https://ce.uci.edu/areas/it/machine_learning/), [KEEL repository](https://sci2s.ugr.es/keel/index.php), and probably from Kaggle too. Datasets for which source/creator link was found, are attached with txt files for the same.
